**Supervised Learning Capstone Project**
=====================================

**Project Overview**
-------------------

This project aims to demonstrate the application of supervised learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. The project uses a dataset Telco-Customer-Churn.csv to train and evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.

**Dataset**
------------

The dataset used in this project is Telco-Customer-Churn.csv.The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 90% samples used for training and 10% samples used for testing.

**Models**
----------

The following supervised learning models are implemented in this project:

* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Ada Boost
